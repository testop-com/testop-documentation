## Risk Management

### Identified Risks & Mitigation Strategies

#### Risk 1: Delayed System Access

- **Impact:** High - Could delay entire project
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Request access in advance (Week 0), escalation path established
- **Contingency:** Focus on documentation review and interview preparation if delayed

#### Risk 2: Limited Stakeholder Availability

- **Impact:** High - Affects user research quality
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Schedule interviews in advance, flexible scheduling, multiple time slots
- **Contingency:** Extend Week 2 activities into Week 3 if needed

#### Risk 3: Insufficient Existing Documentation

- **Impact:** Medium - Requires more discovery time
- **Probability:** High
- **Mitigation:** Allocate extra time for system exploration, work closely with dev team
- **Contingency:** Adjust Week 1 timeline, extend technical analysis

#### Risk 4: Technical Complexity Higher Than Expected

- **Impact:** Medium - May delay technical documentation
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Daily progress monitoring, early identification of complex areas
- **Contingency:** Prioritize critical components, defer non-critical technical details

#### Risk 5: Scope Creep

- **Impact:** High - Could prevent timely delivery
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Clear scope definition, change request process, regular stakeholder alignment
- **Contingency:** Document out-of-scope items for future phases
